        <p id="line1">As a Full Stack Developer, I love to build responsive websites that require conceptual and analytical thinking. Iâ€™m excited to learn more, and honing my skills on Java, Spring, MySQL, Node.js, and learning Angular.
        I am currently working on expanding my toolset in JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, front and back-end programming skills, but my ultimate goal to become a primary front-end developer with back-end knowledge.</p>
        <p id="line2">I am a member of Women Who Code, and attend meetups monthly. Also, I am part of the Hiker Chicks Rock organization as well as the orgainizer of DallasJS study group. We are a group of women who enjoy activities that help inspire and support other women and men in different levels in life.</p>
        <p id="line3">If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.</p>
